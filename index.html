  Today in class i had to leave unexpectadly because the carbon monoxide alarm went off in my building out of nowhere!! So far ive been  doing my best to keep up with the weekly homework which sometimes takes me 15 minutes and other times takes me hours.

	A fun fact that not many people know about me is that i was born and raised in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Below is map of the itty bitty town im from on the island of St. John, as well as a video diary I made in may, after I had unexpectadly returned home due to COVID.
