	This booklet features a project that I worked on last semster in a class called "The Performative Image". Throughout the course we learned about an array of different kinds of photography that have a performative aspect to them, one of those being black and white photography. With this new knowledge, and with weight of the world on my belt (as i was many months into 2020), i decided to pick uo my film camera and direct a performance. Enjoy!
